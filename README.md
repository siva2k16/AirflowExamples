Here is what each section does:

default_args: A dictionary that defines default arguments to pass to each task instance.
my_first_function and my_second_function: These are functions that will be executed by the PythonOperator tasks.
dag: An instance of the DAG class which acts as a container for the workflow.
task1 and task2: These are instances of the PythonOperator, which tie a Python function to a specific task in the workflow.
task1 >> task2: Specifies that task1 should run before task2.
After you place this code into a file in your Airflow dags directory, remember to start both the Airflow web server and the scheduler. Once the scheduler is running, it will automatically pick up the new DAG, and you will be able to see and trigger it from the Airflow web UI.

Please note that we cannot execute the above code in this environment. You will need to run it in your own environment where Airflow is installed and properly configured.
